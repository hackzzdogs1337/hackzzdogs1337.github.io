# ðŸ˜‰ About me

I am Anirudh Narayanan known as hackzzdogs in several discord servers. I currently work as a security analyst. I mostly do Pentesting and Red teaming. I am also skilled in DevSecOps. I also did some bug bounty on Intigriti. I have also developed lab content for Offensive Security Proving Grounds and CyberSecLabs. If you are very much interested in learning about AD and Web app exploitation you can try and solve these labs.&#x20;

#### Offensive Security Proving Grounds:

* Rotten
* Phobos
* Toxic
* Fort
* Hokage
* Vault

#### CyberSecLabs:

* Roast
* Spray
* Sync

I am currently researching on malware development for endpoint evasions and malware analysis. In my free time I love to hear music and read security blogs. If you are a person who wants to talk about any of the above specified areas you can reach out to me anytime on my Discord or my LinkedIn.
